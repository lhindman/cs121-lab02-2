# Module 2 Lab Guide (part 2)

## Lab Activity 2 - HMSConverter (Required)
### Problem Description
Write an application that prompts the user for integer values that represent a time duration in hours, minutes, and seconds, and then calculates and prints the equivalent total number of seconds. For example, 1 hours, 28 minutes, 42 seconds is equivalent to 5322 seconds.  The program user use a Scanner to read input from the user. It is helpful to work out the arithmetic equiation on paper before attempting to write the code. Your program should match the expected output below.

#### Expected Program Output (with sample user input)
```
Enter the number of hours: 1
Enter the number of minutes: 28
Enter the number of seconds: 42

Total seconds: 5322
```

### Impementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named HMSConverter and create a new file named HMSConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in HMSConverter.java
3. Test the program with the sample user input using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Lab Activity 2 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Lab Activity 3 - SecondsConverter (Required)
### Problem Description
Create a version of the previous activity that reverses the computation.  That is, read a value from the user representing a number of seconds, and then print the equivalent amount of time as a combination of hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, 9999 seconds is equivalent to 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 39 seconds. The program user use a Scanner to read input from the user. It is helpful to work out the arithmetic equiation on paper before attempting to write the code. Your program should match the expected output below.

#### Expected Program Output (with sample user input)
```
Enter the number of seconds: 9999

Hours: 2
Minutes: 46
Seconds: 39
```
### Impementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named SecondsConverter and create a new file named SecondsConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in SecondsConverter.java
3. Test the program with the sample user input using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Lab Activity 3 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Coding Journal (Optional)
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two timestamped journal entries of at least a 75 to 150 words each added to the provided Journal.md file.  The purpose of this component is to help develop the habit of taking notes and creating documentation while you code. The more detail you provide the better as that will help you if you ever need to refer back to this project in the future.

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
